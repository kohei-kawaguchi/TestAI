## Goal

Define the estimation exercise that mirrors `scripts/estimate_mdp/estimate_mdp.qmd`, but now focuses on recovering demand and cost primitives of the static oligopoly pricing model using the simulated market outcomes generated in `problems/simulate_opm/simulate_opm.qmd`.

## Required Components

1. **Data ingestion**: Outline how trainees should load simulated datasets (prices, quantities, instruments, cost shifters) and configuration metadata.
2. **Estimation strategy**: Specify a two-step procedure—(i) back out demand shocks from the share equations and estimate demand parameters using GMM, (ii) back out marginal costs from the first-order conditions and estimate the cost parameters by a regression.
3. **Model validation**: Require fit diagnostics, comparison between recovered and true shocks in demand and cost. The shape of the GMM objective function around the true parameter along each dimension.

## Deliverable

An executable Quarto report (to be implemented by juniors) and rendered html report that mirrors the flow of the MDP estimator, but focuses solely on static oligopoly market simulations. Juniors will fill in all code, figures, and tables.
