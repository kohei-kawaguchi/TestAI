## Goal

Define the estimation exercise that mirrors `scripts/estimate_mdp/estimate_mdp.qmd`, but now focuses on recovering demand and cost primitives of the static oligopoly pricing model using the simulated market outcomes generated in `problems/simulate_opm/simulate_opm.qmd`.

## Required Components

1. **Data ingestion**: Outline how trainees should load simulated datasets (prices, quantities, instruments, cost shifters) and configuration metadata.
2. **Estimation strategy**: Specify a two-step procedure—(i) estimate demand elasticities using GMM/IV logit demand, (ii) back out marginal costs or conduct parameters via the first-order conditions.
3. **Nested fixed point analogy**: Highlight where the MDP NFXP logic carries over (solving markup equations inside the likelihood/GMM objective) and what changes in the static setting.
4. **Model validation**: Require fit diagnostics, over-identification tests, or comparison between recovered costs and true simulated costs.

## Deliverable

An estimation report template with no executed code, serving purely as instructions for juniors to build the full oligopoly estimator.
