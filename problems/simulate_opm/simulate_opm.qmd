## Goal

Guide juniors to build the analogue of `scripts/simulate_mdp/simulate_mdp.qmd` for the static oligopoly pricing environment solved in `problems/solve_opm/solve_opm.qmd`. The simulation should draw repeated markets, solve for equilibrium prices using the solver outputs, and collect market-level outcomes (prices, quantities, markups, profits).

## Required Components

1. **Input artifacts**: Describe how to load the specified demand and cost parameters, as well as any solver outputs (e.g., equilibrium price functions or markup fixed-point objects).
2. **Simulation design**: Specify market size, demand shocks, and rival cost shocks that should be resampled each Monte Carlo repetition; stress the need for reproducible seeds via configuration files.
3. **Outputs**: Enumerate summary statistics juniors must produce (distribution of equilibrium prices, markup dispersion, pass-through to costs, comparative statics over cost shocks).
4. **Diagnostics**: Explain how to check equilibrium feasibility (FOC residuals) and how to fail fast when the solver cannot converge for a simulated draw.

## Deliverable

An executable Quarto report (to be implemented by juniors) and rendered html report that mirrors the flow of the MDP simulator but focuses solely on static oligopoly market simulations. Juniors will fill in all code, figures, and tables.
