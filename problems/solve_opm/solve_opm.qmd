## Goal

Replicate the structure of `scripts/solve_mdp/solve_mdp.qmd`, but replace the Markov Decision Process with a **static oligopoly pricing model** in which multiple firms set prices simultaneously to maximize period profits. The objective is to design and document a solver that:

- Specifies firm demand (e.g., logit demand with market share as a function of own price and rivals' prices)
- Defines marginal costs and strategic interaction assumptions (Bertrand competition with differentiated products)
- Derives the Nash equilibrium first-order conditions for optimal prices
- Implements a numerical fixed-point or contraction mapping routine that solves for equilibrium prices and markups under the chosen demand system

## Required Components

1. **Model primitives**: Demand parameters, cost structure, number of firms/products, and any demand and cost shifters.
2. **Equilibrium algorithm**: Specify how to numerically solve the nonlinear system of first-order conditions (FOCs) characterizing the static Nash equilibrium in prices.
3. **Verification plan**: Outline how juniors should validate convergence (e.g., norm of FOC residuals, comparison to analytical benchmarks in symmetric cases).
4. **Documentation**: Describe expected figures/tables (e.g., comparative statics over demand elasticities, passthrough analyses) without implementing them.

## Deliverable

An executable Quarto report (to be implemented by juniors) and rendered html report that mirrors the MDP solver report while focusing entirely on the static oligopoly pricing equilibrium problem. Keep this file as an instruction-only scaffold; all code, figures, and tables are to be authored by the trainees.
