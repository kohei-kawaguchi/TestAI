## Goal

Replicate the structure of `scripts/solve_mdp/solve_mdp.qmd`, but replace the Markov Decision Process with a **static oligopoly pricing model** in which multiple firms set prices simultaneously to maximize period profits. The objective is to design and document a solver that:

- Specifies firm demand (e.g., logit demand with market share as a function of own price and rivals' prices)
- Defines marginal costs and strategic interaction assumptions (Bertrand competition with differentiated products)
- Derives the Nash equilibrium first-order conditions for optimal prices
- Implements a numerical fixed-point or contraction mapping routine that solves for equilibrium prices and markups under the chosen demand system

## Required Components

1. **Model primitives**: Demand parameters, cost structure, number of firms/products, and any instruments or exogenous shifters.
2. **Equilibrium algorithm**: Clear pseudo code mirroring the MDP value-iteration section but adapted for static pricing (e.g., Gauss–Seidel on markup equations or Newton steps on FOCs).
3. **Verification plan**: Outline how juniors should validate convergence (e.g., norm of FOC residuals, comparison to analytical benchmarks in symmetric cases).
4. **Documentation**: Describe expected figures/tables (markup convergence plot, comparative statics over demand elasticities) without implementing them.

## Deliverable

An executable Quarto report (to be implemented by juniors) that mirrors the MDP solver report while focusing entirely on the static oligopoly pricing equilibrium problem. Keep this file as an instruction-only scaffold; all code, figures, and tables are to be authored by the trainees.
