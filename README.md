## Features

### Implemented Methods

1. **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)** (R)
   - Callaway-Sant'Anna estimator for multi-period DiD
   - Support for covariates and multiple treatment periods
   - Robust standard errors with clustered structure

2. **Randomization Inference** (R)
   - Fisher's exact p-value computation
   - Randomization-based hypothesis testing
   - Support for various test statistics

3. **Markov Decision Process Solver** (Python)
   - Neural network-based value function approximation using PyTorch
   - Value iteration algorithm with Bellman operator
   - Type-I extreme value distributed action shocks
   - Continuous state space with discrete binary actions
   - Logarithmic reward function: r(s,a) = β·log(1+s) - a
   - State transition: s' = (1-γ)s + a
   - Monotonic neural network architecture with softplus constraints
   - Comprehensive unit tests covering all subroutines
   - Comparative statics analysis for key parameters (β, γ)

### Datasets

The project includes simulated datasets with:

**DiD Multi-Period Datasets:**
- **df_design_cov**: Panel data with covariates affecting treatment assignment and trends
- **df_design_nocov**: Panel data with unconditional parallel trends
- **df_design_nyt**: Panel data with no never-treated units (all eventually treated)

**Randomization Inference Dataset:**
- **data_realized**: Cross-sectional randomized experiment data with binary treatment assignment

## Usage

### Installation

#### R Package
```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("devtools", "did", "dplyr", "ggplot2", "kableExtra",
                   "modelsummary", "plm", "clubSandwich", "fastDummies"))

# Load the package
devtools::load_all()
```

#### Python Package
```bash
# Using uv (recommended)
uv sync

# Or using pip
pip install torch numpy matplotlib pytest
```

### Running Analyses

#### R Analyses
```r
# Run DiD multi-period analysis
rmarkdown::render('scripts/analyze_data/analyze_did_multiperiods.Rmd')

# Run randomization inference analysis
rmarkdown::render('scripts/analyze_data/randomization_fisher_pvalue.Rmd')

# Validate against ground truth
source('scripts/analyze_data_true/compare_results.R')
```

#### MDP Pipeline (Solver → Simulator → Estimator)

Run the complete MDP pipeline sequentially:

```bash
# Run all three steps: solver, simulator, and estimator
./scripts/run_mdp.sh
```

This script will:
1. Solve the MDP using value iteration (saves to `output/solve_mdp/`)
2. Simulate data from the solved model (saves to `output/simulate_mdp/`)
3. Estimate parameters from simulated data (saves to `output/estimate_mdp/`)

Or run individual steps:

**MDP Solver**
```bash
# Run unit tests
uv run pytest test/

# Render solver report
cd scripts/solve_mdp
uv run quarto render solve_mdp.qmd

# Launch live preview (serves at http://127.0.0.1:4200 after port-forwarding)
uv run quarto preview scripts/solve_mdp/solve_mdp.qmd
```

**MDP Simulator**
```bash
# Render simulator report (requires solver output)
cd scripts/simulate_mdp
uv run quarto render simulate_mdp.qmd

# Launch live preview (serves at http://127.0.0.1:4300 after port-forwarding)
uv run quarto preview scripts/simulate_mdp/simulate_mdp.qmd
```

**MDP Estimator**
```bash
# Render estimator report (requires simulator output)
cd scripts/estimate_mdp
uv run quarto render estimate_mdp.qmd

# Launch live preview (serves at http://127.0.0.1:4400 after port-forwarding)
uv run quarto preview scripts/estimate_mdp/estimate_mdp.qmd
```

**Container workflow:**
When working inside a container (e.g., VS Code Dev Containers), forward ports `4200`, `4300`, and `4400` to access the live previews for solver, simulator, and estimator respectively.

**Quarto workflow with cached figures:**
- Always use the project environment: `uv run` or prefix commands with `QUARTO_PYTHON=.venv/bin/python`
- Render once with execution enabled: `uv run quarto render <document.qmd>`
- For previews, reuse the cache: `uv run quarto preview <document.qmd>`
- Avoid `--no-execute` unless you only need text; it strips figure references from the regenerated HTML
- To share a static copy, bundle the HTML with `*_files/` or render with `--self-contained`

## Validation Results

### DiD Implementation Validation

Comparison of AI-generated implementations against manual ground truth:

| Dataset | Ground Truth ATT | AI Implementation ATT | Difference | Status |
|---------|------------------|----------------------|------------|--------|
| Dataset 1 (with covariates) | 0.030235 | 0.030235 | 0.000000 | ✓ Perfect Match |
| Dataset 2 (without covariates) | 0.028018 | 0.028018 | 0.000000 | ✓ Perfect Match |
| Dataset 3 (not-yet-treated) | 0.034936 | 0.036461 | 0.001526 | ✓ Correct (AI includes covariates) |

See [docs/conversation/ground_truth_comparison_conversation_transcript.md](docs/conversation/ground_truth_comparison_conversation_transcript.md) for details.

### MDP Solver Test Results

All 45 unit tests pass, covering:
- Mean reward computation with logarithmic form
- State transition dynamics
- Bellman operator application
- Choice probability calculation with logit structure
- Neural network monotonicity constraints
- Value iteration convergence
- End-to-end value function optimization

The solver successfully produces:
- Converged value functions for both actions (a=0, a=1)
- Optimal state-dependent policies exhibiting threshold structure
- Comparative statics showing intuitive parameter effects on value and policy
