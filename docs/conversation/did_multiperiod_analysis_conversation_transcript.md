# Conversation Transcript: Difference-in-Differences Multi-Period Analysis

This document contains the raw conversation history showing how to prompt AI assistants for conducting staggered difference-in-differences analysis using the Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021) method.

---

## Initial Setup

**User:**
> In scripts/analyze_data, make an Rmarkdown file that reads output/difference_in_difference data sets, and describe the data. Render it and show it in a live server.

**Assistant:** [Creates R Markdown file, renders it, and launches live server]

**User:**
> It is returning 401

**Assistant:** [Troubleshoots live server port conflicts and restarts server]

---

## Understanding Data Structure

**User:**
> Focus on data set 1. What are rows with NA in group?

**Assistant:** [Checks for NA values in group column, finds none]

**User:**
> Oh, NA are shown for means for logical and or categorical variables

**Key Learning:** The `summary()` function shows NA for mean statistics of non-numeric variables. This is expected behavior, not missing data.

---

## Improving Summary Statistics

**User:**
> Divide the summary tables by variable types. Also, put variables on the rows and statistics on the columns

**Assistant:** [Refactors summary statistics for dataset 1 into three separate tables: Numeric, Logical, and Character variables, with variables as rows and statistics as columns]

**User:**
> When I asked you to reformat the summary table, you only applied the change to the data set 1. Apply the same change to all the data sets.

**Key Learning:** When making structural changes, explicitly check if the same pattern should be applied across all similar sections.

**Assistant:** [Applies the same summary table formatting to datasets 2 and 3]

---

## Establishing Analysis Context

**User:**
> Data set 1 is a panel data set with staggered interventions. Do you understand this?

**Assistant:**
> Yes, I understand. Dataset 1 (df_design_cov) is a panel dataset with staggered interventions, meaning:
> - Panel structure: Multiple units (identified by `id`) observed over multiple time periods (identified by `time`)
> - Staggered interventions: Different units receive treatment at different time points, rather than all units being treated simultaneously

**User:**
> You are correct. In addition to that, the data comes with the covariates. So, the expected outcomes and propensity scores are functions of the covariates. Do you understand this?

**Assistant:**
> Yes, I understand. In addition to the panel structure with staggered interventions:
> - Covariates: Variables like `x1_i` and `x2_i` are unit-level covariates
> - Confounding: These covariates affect both:
>   - Treatment assignment (propensity scores)
>   - Potential outcomes
> This creates a selection-on-observables scenario

**User:**
> Here, we would like to estimate the average treatment effects on treated, taking the above issues into consideration. Do you know how to do this in this context?

**Assistant:** [Lists several appropriate methods for staggered DiD with covariates, including Callaway and Sant'Anna (2021)]

## Finding and Understanding the Package

**User:**
> Sounds good. We would like to apply Callaway and Sant'Anna's method. Can you find their R package for implementing the analysis? As you find it, read the help to understand how the package works and summarize it

**Assistant:** [Searches for package, finds `did` package, installs it, reads documentation]

**Summary provided:**
- Main package: `did`
- Core functions: `att_gt()`, `aggte()`, `ggdid()`
- Three estimator types: Outcome regression, IPW, Doubly robust
- Handles covariates for conditional parallel trends
- Requires long-format panel data with treatment timing variable

---

## Documenting the Analysis Plan

**User:**
> Summarize the analysis plan and the usage of the package in the report, and refresh it

**Assistant:** [Adds comprehensive overview section to R Markdown including:
- Data context (panel structure, staggered treatment, covariates)
- Analysis objective (estimate ATT)
- Method description (Callaway and Sant'Anna 2021)
- Package usage details]

**User:**
> commit changes

**User:**
> use here package for the path

**Key Learning:** Use `here()` for robust path handling across different working directories.

---

## Implementing the Analysis

**User:**
> Using callaway and santanna's method, we estimate the average treatment effect on treated with data set 1. You already correctly corresponded the variable names in the data set and in the package formula. Please implement it and add the results in the report, then refresh it.

**Assistant:** [Implements complete ATT estimation for dataset 1:
- Group-time ATT estimation with doubly robust estimator
- Overall ATT aggregation
- Event study/dynamic effects
- Group-specific effects
- Calendar time effects]

**Variable mapping:**
```r
att_gt(
  yname = "y_it",           # Outcome
  tname = "time",            # Time period
  idname = "id",             # Unit ID
  gname = "group_i",         # Treatment timing (0 = never-treated)
  xformla = ~x1_i + x2_i,    # Covariates
  data = df_cov,
  control_group = "nevertreated",
  est_method = "dr"
)
```

---

## Extending to Other Datasets

**User:**
> The implementation looks good. Apply this to data set 2 as well. This is a special case without covariate. In data set 3, we do not have a never treated group. In this case, you need to use "notyettreated" as the control. Add the results to the report and refresh it.

**Key Differences:**

1. **Dataset 2 (No covariates):**
   - Set `xformla = ~1` (intercept only)
   - Still use `control_group = "nevertreated"`

2. **Dataset 3 (No never-treated group):**
   - Include covariates: `xformla = ~x1_i + x2_i`
   - Use `control_group = "notyettreated"` instead

**Assistant:** [Implements ATT estimation for both datasets 2 and 3 with appropriate specifications]

---

## Key Learnings

1. **Incremental Development:** Build analysis step-by-step rather than jumping to full implementation
2. **Consistency:** Apply formatting and structural changes across all similar sections
3. **Context Matters:** Different data designs require different control group specifications:
   - Never-treated controls when available (conventional DiD)
   - Not-yet-treated controls when all units eventually get treated (staggered rollout)
4. **Covariate Handling:** Use `xformla = ~1` for no covariates, not omitting the parameter
5. **Documentation:** Document the analysis plan and method details before implementing
6. **Path Management:** Use `here()` package for reproducible file paths

## Technical Notes

### Control Group Selection
- `control_group = "nevertreated"`: Use when some units never receive treatment
- `control_group = "notyettreated"`: Use when all units eventually receive treatment at different times

### Covariate Specification
- With covariates: `xformla = ~x1_i + x2_i`
- Without covariates: `xformla = ~1`

### Aggregation Types
- `type = "simple"`: Overall ATT (weighted average)
- `type = "dynamic"`: Event study effects (by relative time to treatment)
- `type = "group"`: Effects by treatment cohort
- `type = "calendar"`: Effects by calendar time period
