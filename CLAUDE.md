# Guidelines for Claude

## Git Operations

**Do not git add/commit without explicit user request.**

- Only run `git add` and `git commit` when the user explicitly asks to "commit changes" or similar
- Do not automatically commit after completing tasks
- Do not batch multiple changes into commits without permission
- Wait for explicit confirmation before pushing to remote repositories
